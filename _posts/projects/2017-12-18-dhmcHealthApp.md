Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center wished to address flaws in its patient intake system. The goal was to create a prototype application to improve data collection and analysis, while ensuring enjoyable patient stays. Its main feature was a personalized patient profile which would allow medical staff to record information otherwise not present in traditional EHRs, but useful in the provision of patient care. This includes, but is not limited to dietary prferences, exercise habits and sleep patterns. 


#### Highlights
* Worked as lead engineer on a 5-man team, primarily responsible for the architecture
* Bundled app with JavaDB (Derby) to ensure portability and a smooth, easy initialization process
* Designed app to use space and memory efficiently, since it had to run on low-power Microsoft tablet.
* Used Agile Scrum methodology


#### Low-Lights
* A significant cut in team size led to some features being underdeveloped or dropped entirely, such as our data analysis portal
