For my Major Qualifying Project (MQP), which is similar to a senior capstone, I worked in a team of 3 to develop the foundation for a Health Information System tailored to the Sub-Saharan environment. Our prototype solution, VermaMS, is an minimal EHR system that stores patient history, with emphasis on those diagnosed with malaria, tuberculosis or meningitis. The application featured report generation for each patient visit, as well as basic graphical analysis tools. As it stands, the app could either be integrated with a hospital's current record-keeping, or developed into a full blown EHR.


#### Tech Stack
* Java
* JavaFX
* Amazon Redshift + RDS
* Oracle
* Apache Shiro

#### Highlights
* I was responsible for a bulk of the business logic, both designing and coding
* Built app around a centralized Oracle database on our school server, and backed up to Amazon RDS
* Application security - authentication and authorization - was handled through the Apache Shiro integration
