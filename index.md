Welcome to my Jekyll mini-site! This is a portal into my world, with sections for professional and entertainment endeavors. Take a look around! :)
  

## Moi meme

First and foremost, I'm a [Ghana][ghana-facts] yout currently residing in these United States of America. Education brought me to these opportune shores, and I'm in my final semester of getting my undergrad degree in Computer Science. It's been a long road but we almost there!

Now about *me* :)

Imagine a (very) dark-skinned, curly-haired nerd of average height with creative intuition. Oh, and a recently developed athletic build. That's me. As a child, anyone with a future in education was expected to confine themselves to that only, and I was no exception. Fortunately, growing up and having the chance to live in different parts of the world, I realized there are several people who have been successful at marrying these seemingly disparate facets of life. Since that epiphany (of sorts) I aspire to explore each of my diverse interests and talents to my full potential.
