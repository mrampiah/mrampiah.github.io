Ebenezer Ampiah was an outstanding student who took my CS3733 Software Engineering course, served as an undergraduate teaching assistant for the software engineering course, and completed a senior capstone project supervised by me. 
 
Ebenezer took my CS3733 Software Engineering course in the spring of 2016. This highly rigorous course had student teams working to apply Agile development methodologies and software design patterns in Java to create real-world applications for  business clients. Ebenezer was the lead software engineer of his eight-person team to create a proof-of-concept medical application for the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center to capture cancer patients’ non-clinical data in order to improve the quality of care. Ebenezer and his team not only developed the required desktop application in seven weeks, but Ebenezer was able to successfully port the application onto the hospital’s tablets which were provided only one week before the end of the term! 
 
From October 2016 to May 2017 Ebenezer, along with his two teammates, developed a disease tracking electronic health record (EHR) system for Ghana in order to improve efficiency within medical facilities and to increase the quality of patient care. With the input of a retired physician, Ebenezer’s team developed a truly impressive electronic health record system that is tailored to the way doctors and nurses work.  
 
As a result of his outstanding accomplishments, I employed Ebenezer in the spring of 2018 to be one of the undergraduate teaching assistants for my software engineering class. This course had ten-person student teams working  to to create an indoor pathfinding application with service request modules for Brigham & Women’s Hospital’s main campus. As part of his reponsibilities as an undergraduate teaching assistant, Ebenezer served as an excellent coach for a software development team of ten students, assisted me with the creation of assignments and performed grading. Ebenezer executed all of his duties with the utmost diligence. 
 
In summary, I believe Ebenezer’s leadership and programming ability, software engineering knowledge, incredible work ethic, and enthusiasm make him an outstanding candidate for your company. I give him my highest recommendation. Please contact me through email at wwong2@wpi.edu if you have any questions.
