First and foremost, I'm a [Ghana][ghana-facts] yute currently residing in these United States of America. Education brought me to these opportune shores for undergraduate degree in Computer Science. It's been a long road but we finally done!

Imagine a (very) dark-skinned, curly-haired nerd of average height with creative intuition. Oh, and a recently developed athletic build. That's me. As a child, anyone with a future in education was expected to confine themselves to that only, and I was no exception. Fortunately, growing up and having the chance to live in different parts of the world, I realized there are several people who have been successful at marrying these seemingly disparate facets of life. Since that epiphany (of sorts) I aspire to explore each of my diverse interests and talents to my full potential. More in [The Fun Zone][fun-zone] :)

Now to the main reason for this page - to potential future employers, I have my resume along with a recommendation from one of my professors in the following sections. Also check out projects I've completed including links to code in the [Portfolio][portfolio] section. Thanks!
