Despite being totally fascinated by the arts, particularly music and movies, a combination of fear and lack of confidence have limited my contribution. 

So for now, I've got only one song up on soundcloud which was recorded towards the end of high school. Please listen below; more tracks soon come :)

Still on the topic of music, here's one of my Spotify playlists. I chose this out of quite a few because it captures a recent period of bliss while showcasing the genius of African music; a heritage I'm quite proud of.

The bigger shame is not having anything to show for past video endeavours. In high school I produced a number of videos for both entertainment and serious purposes. However, these have been lost through lack of adequate backup and until I find someone with a hidden copy, they'll be residing in the memories of school mates. No biggie, those were veery amateurish videos and would only serve as nostalgic pieces.

So for movies, I'll be giving a list of some of my favorite movies (in no particular order). I might build on or alter the list as time goes on and new faves are discovered - or remembered :D.
